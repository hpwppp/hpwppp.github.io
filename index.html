                            I attended a technical meetup organised by Python Adelaide titled "Clean Architecture in
                            Python: Why, When, and How," presented by Matt Magin, a staff+ software engineer
                            specialising in distributed backend systems. The session covered the principles and
                            rationale for clean architecture, clarified common misconceptions, and provided actionable
                            implementation strategies in Python projects. Matt discussed how clean architecture ensures
                            maintainability and scalability, using real-world examples from his experience. This event
                            enhanced my awareness of best practices in software engineering and provided me networking
                            opportunities with fellow students and industry professionals.

                            I completed the "Hands-On Essentials: Data Warehouse" badge issued by Snowflake, which
                            included guided practical labs. The workshop focused on foundational data warehousing skills
                            within the Snowflake platform. I demonstrated the ability to create, edit, and manage
                            Snowflake tables, file formats, compute resources, and COPY INTO statements, as well as
                            parse and load CSV and JSON data. The experience simulated real-world scenarios in a
                            cloud-based data environment.

                            Following my initial support session, I had a mock interview with Sharon from Central Career
                            Services. In this session, I applied Sharon’s previous advice, using the STAR method to
                            structure my responses and tailoring my answers to highlight both technical and
                            interpersonal skills. Sharon simulated real interview conditions with a mix of
                            scenario-based and behavioral questions - some specifically inspired by PwC’s interview
                            style. She provided in-depth feedback on my communication, body language, and strategies for
                            articulating my skills.

                        previous session. Applying the STAR method made my answers more focused and impactful, and I
                        received valuable feedback on how to improve my delivery and presence in high-pressure
                        scenarios. Sharon’s insights into what employers are really looking for - beyond just technical
                        skills - gave me a better sense of how to express my adaptability and genuine enthusiasm for the
                        role. Overall, I finished the session feeling more self-aware, prepared, and confident to
                        approach real-world interviews.

                            I attended the 2025 English Pronunciation and Fluency Workshop, presented online by Georgie
                            Harding (Speech Pathologist and Founder of Speech Active). The workshop focused on improving
                            English pronunciation, building fluency, and developing effective small talk skills which
                            are essential for job interviews, networking, and everyday workplace communication. We
                            reviewed common pronunciation mistakes made by non-native speakers, practiced correcting
                            them, and shared tools and resources to keep improving outside the session. One highlight
                            was learning about the Speech Active Online Course launching in August, for which I have
                            already registered to continue my language development. The Q&A session was especially
                            useful, as Georgie gave individualised tips and encouragement.

                        This workshop gave me practical methods for speaking more clearly and confidently, which I know
                        is highly valued by Australian employers. I learned specific tips to recognise and overcome my
                        pronunciation challenges and had the chance to participate actively in real-time exercises. The
                        workshop, taught by an expert with many years’ experience, motivated me to dedicate more time to
                        practicing English daily so I can make a great impression at interviews, in group projects, and
                        in my future workplace.

                            cutting-edge facilities, including live demonstrations of innovations in mineral
                            exploration. The tour included a presentation on the company’s recent advancements,
                            technologies being deployed in the field, and future directions in partnership and research.
                            The event concluded with a networking session over drinks and canapés, where I engaged with
                            Austmine members, industry peers, and technology professionals.

                            I completed a digital interview for the Deloitte Australia Graduate. The interview consisted
                            of five questions, each with a strict time constraint and only one minute to prepare my
                            responses before recording. The questions covered topics including teamwork,
                            problem-solving, communication skills, adapting to change, and career motivation. This
                            challenging format simulated real-world scenarios where concise, clear thinking under time
                            pressure is essential.

                        within tight deadlines. I found the time-limited responses pushed me to organise my thoughts
                        ahead and focus only on key points, which is a skill highly relevant to professional settings.
                        Practicing strategies like the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method beforehand helped
                        me respond more coherently. This experience also gave me firsthand insight into the digital
                        recruitment methods used by top firms and highlighted areas—for example, conciseness and stress
                        management—where I can still improve for future interviews.

                        Participating in this seminar broadened my perspective on how pivotal AI is becoming in
                        contemporary leadership. I gained practical insights that are directly applicable to shaping an
                        AI-ready career, especially in adapting quickly to emerging standards in ethics, innovation, and
                        team leadership.

                    <p>Before taking part in these activities, I saw myself mainly as someone with technical ability,
                        work experience but with little interview experience. For this reason, I found it difficult to
                        talk about my achievements and wasn’t sure how to “sell” myself to employers. I also knew that
                        things like networking, interviews, and writing job applications would be important for my
                        career, but I had very little practice and often felt nervous or unsure about doing these
                        things.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As I went through the workshops, careers appointments, industry talks, and my internship, my
                        perspective started to change. I realised that being successful in IT is not just about
                        technical knowledge; communication, self-awareness, and the ability to connect with other people
                        matter just as much. The mock interviews and CV reviews showed me where I needed to improve,
                        while the tech talks and site tour helped me understand the different directions my career could
                        take. Now, I feel more balanced in my approach. I am more open to learning from feedback, I know
                        where to seek help, and I am much more confident talking to professionals and presenting myself
                        as someone ready for the workplace.

                            Session</h4>

                        <div class="star-title">Situation</div>
                        <div class="star-content">Earlier this semester, I was getting ready to apply for graduate jobs,
                            and I was aware that my interview skills were not as strong as they should be. I had done
                            some interviews before, but mostly in low-pressure settings, and I lacked confidence talking
                            about myself in a professional environment. The Careers Service at the University offered a
                            mock interview with Sharon, which seemed like a good way to practise in a realistic
                            environment.</div>

                        <div class="star-title">Task</div>
                        <div class="star-content">I needed to prepare properly for the mock interview, making sure I had
                            examples ready for common questions, especially those using the STAR method. My main aim was
                            to present myself clearly, show genuine enthusiasm, and get honest feedback about my
                            strengths and weaknesses. I also wanted to practise adapting to more formal, professional
                            conversations and see how I handled nerves.</div>

                        <div class="star-title">Action</div>
                        <div class="star-content">I started by reading over my CV and thinking about situations where
                            I’d shown teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership. During the mock interview, I did my
                            best to answer each question using the STAR method and tried to keep my answers relevant and
                            to the point. After the interview, Sharon went through what I’d done well such as keeping
                            calm and giving real examples - and what I could improve, like not over-explaining and
                            making sure each answer had a clear result.
                        </div>

                        <div class="star-title">Result</div>
                        <div class="star-content">The session was really helpful because it showed me exactly where I
                            was going wrong. I realised I could easily lose track of my answers or talk for too long.
                            Sharon’s feedback was supportive, and it helped me build a plan for future improvement. I
                            left feeling more comfortable with the interview process and more aware of how to sell
                            myself in a fair and genuine way. I used what I had learned to prepare for my actual PwC
                            interview, which went much better than it would have otherwise.</div>

                        <div class="star-title">Learning/Planning</div>
                        <div class="star-content">From this mock interview, I learned that preparation is key, and that
                            answering questions clearly makes a big difference. It was also clear that employers really
                            value you showing your learning and growth, not just talking about what you already know.
                            Going forward, I will keep practising mock interviews, ask for feedback regularly, and make
                            sure my examples are always specific and to the point. I now plan to help friends with their
                            interviews too, as teaching others will help me remember the good habits I have developed.

                        <div class="star-content">As part of my internship at Digital Twinning Australia, I joined my
                            colleagues for a site tour of Fleet Space Technologies. Most of the people there were
                            already working in the technology or mining industry, with years more experience than I
                            have. The visit was part information session, part networking event, and it was the first
                            time I had seen an innovative company like Fleet Space up close.</div>

                        <div class="star-title">Task</div>
                        <div class="star-content">My main aim was to learn more about how a real tech company works,
                            meet people who work in the field, and see what skills matter in industry settings. I also
                            wanted to step out of my comfort zone, ask questions directly to the engineers and managers,
                            and show that I was eager to learn. Joining the networking afterwards was a bit
                            intimidating, but I knew it was important if I wanted to stand out as an intern.</div>

                        <div class="star-title">Action</div>
                        <div class="star-content">During the tour, I paid close attention to the presentations and
                            demonstrations. I made notes and prepared questions about the technology and the company’s
                            future plans. When I got a chance, I asked about the challenges they face and what skills
                            they look for in new hires. At the networking event afterwards, I introduced myself to
                            several people I had not met before, explained what I was studying, and listened to their
                            stories about getting started in their careers.

                        <div class="star-content">I left the event feeling much more informed about the industry and
                            what is possible with a technical background like mine. I also realised that people in the
                            industry are usually happy to talk to students and share advice, which made me feel more
                            confident about approaching new people in the future. </div>

                            seeking out industry events, networking opportunities, and chances to learn directly from

                <p>This semester has fundamentally changed how I view professional development. I've evolved from
                    focusing solely on technical skills to equally valuing communication, networking, and
                    self-presentation abilities. These experiences have made me more confident, adaptable, and genuinely
                    ready for the professional world.</p>

                <p>Moving forward, I'm committed to applying these learnings throughout my career, maintaining the
                    growth mindset I've developed, and continuing to seek opportunities that challenge me to grow both
                    personally and professionally.</p>
